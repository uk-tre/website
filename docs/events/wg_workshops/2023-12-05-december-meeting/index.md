## Background

​The UK TRE Community is a community of over 200 people that has grown organically over the last year for anyone interested in TREs, including researchers, operators, information governors, managers and more, from all sectors and disciplines.

​The core aims of fostering collaboration and sharing of innovative ideas to support the delivery of groundbreaking research with sensitive data have resonated across the UK and beyond.

​The community has a website, an active mailing list and Slack channel, and runs quarterly events like this for the community to come together, discuss ideas and problems within the TRE space and work collaboratively together on possible solutions and ways forward!

### Keynote

A talk by the Community Management Working Group on the latest developments, funding and plans for the community.

#### Summary

The talk discussed why the UK TRE Community exists, and the plans for the community for the next 4 months.

The community considers itself to be a connecting force in the already very active and energetic UK TRE space, helping projects and teams in bringing their work to the wider community, achieving consensus and moving towards a shared approach to TRE provision across the UK's 4 nations.

The community shared an initial vision and mission for the community:

```{admonition} Vision
:class: hint

To have a four nations, coordinated, collaborative approach to research infrastructure for working with sensitive data
```

```{admonition} Mission
:class: hint

To provide the space to signpost, share knowledge and facilitate conversations across the UK TRE landscape
```

The talk then went into detail on the proposed work for the next 4 months.
This was based on the proposal submitted for the DARE UK Community groups funding.
More detail can be found in the [full proposal](https://zenodo.org/records/10593493)

#### Community of Interest on semi-automated evaluation

_Jim Smith_

Jim advertised the breakout session happening on the DARE UK Community of Interest on semi-automated evaluation.

### Breakout sessions

Breakout rooms were a mixture of workshops (more structured sessions designed around a particular problem area, focused on moving towards an output) and discussions (less structured sessions to explore general areas of interest within the UK TRE space), as well as open rooms to have general discussions.

There were two sessions on the day of 45 minutes each.
