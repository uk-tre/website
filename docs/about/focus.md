# Our current focus

The community has recently received funding as part of the DARE UK Community Groups funding cycle, running until March 2024.

Our funding proposal was written collaboratively by over 15 members of the community. Thank you to all those who were involved!

Below is a summary of what we have committed to delivering in the funding proposal.
Our current focus is on delivering the below, which is reflected in the structure, and ongoing work, of our [open community project board](https://github.com/orgs/uk-tre/projects/1/views/1).

## Key deliverables

### 1 Strengthening the community

#### 1.1 Governance

We're creating a clear governance structure for the community.
This includes updating our governing document, establishing governance principles and processes, and creating a sustainability model for the community.

#### 1.2 Roadmap

We're developing a roadmap to lay out key activities for the UK TRE community to thrive.
This includes identifying key activities being undertaken, or ideally to be undertaken by the community, required resources and timeframes, and current statuses.

### 2 Enhancing outreach and engagement

#### 2.1 Landscape review

We're working with members of the community to develop a clear picture of the current UK TRE landscape, and ensure diverse representation across the community.
This includes current work, teams, organisations, funding opportunities, TRE definitions and implementations, impact industries and groups, and more.

#### 2.2 Public engagement

We're developing a public engagement activity pipeline.

This will build on work already being done in key public engagment groups like [use MY data](https://www.usemydata.org/) and [PEDRI](https://www.pedri.org.uk/).

#### 2.3 Event and collaboration spaces

We're enhancing our event provision and community workspaces.

This will build off our [quarterly community events](../events/index.md), and may include regluar town halls, governance meetings and additional required communication channels.

### 3 Resource hub

#### 3.1 UK TRE website

We're developing the website to be easier to use, and contain key resources and events relevant to the UK TRE Community.

This will become the central place to find out everything happened, and created and shared, across the community!

#### 3.2 Content generation

We're building an open bank of resources and outputs created by the community.

These resources can be picked up and re-used across organisations, and represent the latest thinking and developments across the UK in the TRE space.

#### 3.3 Contribution pathways

We're developing effective contribution and engagement methods for the whole community.

This includes both technical and non technical methods of contributing and getting involved!
