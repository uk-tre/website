# Code of Conduct

We are dedicated to providing a welcoming and supportive environment for all people, regardless of background or identity.
As such, we do not tolerate behaviour that is disrespectful to our community members or that excludes, intimidates, or causes discomfort to others.
We do not tolerate discrimination or harassment based on characteristics that include, but are not limited to: gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, citizenship, nationality, ethnic or social origin, pregnancy, familial status, veteran status, genetic information, religion or belief (or lack thereof), membership of a national minority, property, age, education, socio-economic status, technical choices, and experience level.

To make clear what is expected, we ask all members of the community to conform to the following Code of Conduct.
This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when
an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.
Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address,
posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our
community include:

- Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
- Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
- Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes,
  and learning from the experience
- Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the
  overall community

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or
  advances of any kind
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email
  address, without their explicit permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of
acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive,
or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject
comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are
not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation
decisions when appropriate.

## Incident Reporting

If you experience or witness unacceptable behaviour, or have any other concerns, please report it
by contacting David Sarmiento Perez at [dsarmientoperez@turing.ac.uk](mailto:dsarmientoperez@turing.ac.uk), or Simon Li at [s.p.li@dundee.ac.uk](mailto:s.p.li@dundee.ac.uk).

In your report please include:

- Your contact information.

- Names (real, nicknames, or pseudonyms) of any individuals involved. If there
  are additional witnesses, please include them as well. Your account of what
  occurred, and if you believe the incident is ongoing. If there is a publicly
  available record (e.g. a mailing list archive or a public IRC logger), please
  include a link.

- Any additional information that may be helpful.

We will respect confidentiality requests all the time for the purpose of protecting individuals who have been harmed.

### Terminology

- Reporter: Person reporting an incident.
- Reportee: Person being reported.

## Report Handling Process

After receiving a report, the community leaders (or person handling the report) will review the incident report and follow this process to determine the cause and consequences that violated this Code of Conduct and take further actions:

Community leaders will reach out to the reporter to ask for further information if the submitted report is not complete or needs some additional context.
Community leaders will also ensure that person impacted or harmed by the reported incident is safe and identify how they can be further supported.

A meeting with the reportee will be scheduled where the person handling the report will discuss four questions:

- What happened?
- What were you thinking at the time?
- Who has been affected by what you have done? In what way?
- What do you think you need to do to make things right?

When the incident in question inflicted harm on another person, additional
questions will be asked on behalf of the person(s) harmed:

- What did you think when you realized what had happened?
- What impact has this incident had on you and others?
- What do you think needs to happen to make things right?

The person handling the report may follow up with reportee or reporter after this discussion
with any additional questions to help them reach a resolution.

### Resolutions

Here are examples of possible resolutions to a report.
This list is not comprehensive, and any action necessary to reach a fair resolution will be taken as needed.
Possible resolutions to an incident include:

- a private communication from community leaders, providing
  clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the
  behaviour was inappropriate.
- an apology to the person harmed or the team as a whole
- an action plan for the reportee to improve their awareness and correct future behaviours
- if confirmed by the person reporting, reportee will have no interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with
  those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period. This includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels like social media.
- not publishing the content that violated the Code of Conduct, until necessary changes have been made and agreed upon by the person handling the report.
- an imposed suspension, such as asking reportee to “take a week off” from the community.
- a stronger warning with consequences for continued behaviour.

The person handling the report will maintain records of all reports so that they may be reviewed if stronger measures are required when repeated violations occur by the same individual, as well as to improve our Code of Conduct for future participation.

Once a resolution is agreed upon, but before it is enacted, the person handling the report will contact the reporter and any other affected parties to explain the proposed resolution.
They will ask if this resolution is acceptable and must note feedback for the record. However, they are not required to act on this feedback.

The reportee will be contacted via email informing them of the resolution.
A final meeting may be conducted if necessary.

### Conflict of Interest

All reports will be kept confidential with details shared only with people involved in report handling.
If a person handling the report is linked with the ongoing issue, they will declare their Conflict of Interest and remove themselves from any discussion related to the report handling.
Resolution action may also include identifying appropriate members from within the community if more support for the person handling the report is needed.

## Feedback
